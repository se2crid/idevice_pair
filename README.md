2. **Launch the application** - it will automatically scan for connected devices
3. **Select your device** from the dropdown menu
4. **Enable wireless debugging** if desired for wireless connectivity

### Managing Pairing Files

The application can generate and manage pairing files for various sideloading applications:

1. **Load existing pairing file**: Click "Load Pairing File" to import from your device
2. **Generate new pairing file**: Click "Generate Pairing File" to create a fresh pairing
3. **Save pairing file**: Export the pairing file for use with supported applications
4. **Validate pairing**: Test the pairing file against a network-connected device

### Wireless Debugging

To enable wireless debugging:

1. Connect your device via USB
2. Select your device from the list
3. Click "Enable Wireless" 
4. Your device will now be accessible over the network

## Pairing Guide

idevice_pair allows you to create a pairing file for programs like StikDebug to communicate with your device remotely. This pairing file is device-specific and required for tools like StikDebug to function correctly.

### Prerequisites for Pairing

Before creating a pairing file, ensure you have:

1. **Set a passcode** on your iOS device
2. **Sideloaded an app** with the get-task-allow entitlement (can be done with [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/) or similar tools)
3. **Enabled Developer Mode** on your iOS/iPadOS device (found in Settings → Privacy & Security after sideloading an app)

2. Open the Disk Image and drag `idevice pair` to `Applications`

#### Windows
1. Install iTunes ([64-bit](https://apple.com/itunes/download/win64) or [32-bit](https://apple.com/itunes/download/win32)) from Apple's website
2. Download [idevice pair for Windows](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice_pair/releases/latest/download/idevice_pair--windows-x86_64.exe) and save it to a memorable location

#### Linux
1. Install usbmuxd: 
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y usbmuxd
   ```
2. Download idevice_pair for your architecture:
   - [x86_64](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice_pair/releases/latest/download/idevice_pair--linux-x86_64.AppImage)
   - [AArch64](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice_pair/releases/latest/download/idevice_pair--linux-aarch64.AppImage)
3. Make the downloaded file executable

### Pairing Instructions

1. **Connect your device** to your computer via USB cable
   - If prompted, select `Trust` and enter your passcode
2. **Open idevice pair** and select your device from the dropdown menu
3. **Load pairing file**: 
   - Ensure your device is unlocked and on the home screen
   - Click `Load Pairing File`
   - If prompted on your device, tap `Trust` and enter your passcode
4. **Install for your app**:
   - Keep your device unlocked and on the home screen
   - Scroll down and click `Install` under your target application (e.g., "StikDebug")
   - You should see `Success` appear in green

## Supported Applications
